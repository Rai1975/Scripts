\content{
  Dear Recruiter, \\
  
  My name is Raihan Rafeek and I am a 4th year computer science major at the University of Cincinnati. I am interested in the POSITION_NAME position at COMPANY_NAME because it rings my bell, it is the exact kind of position I would love to work for.\\

  I have significant experience that aligns perfectly with the position's requirements and I would love to take this opportunity to sharpen my skills in a real-world environment. I have previously worked for an AI-based startup where I had to work cross-functionally to support the fast moving environment and customer requirements, including traveling to different states to deploy applications, talking to customers and also developing code. This experience taught me a lot about development and working closely with clients in a startup environment. I am also part of my university's prestigious presidential scholarship called the NEXT Innovation Scholar's Program. As part of this program, I work closely with partners like USBank, Kao and the University of Cincinnati. This program revolves around finding innovative solutions to problems the clients didn't even know they had, through insight generation and storyboarding.\\

In addition, I have done previous internships at government nuclear laboratories where I had to work on safety critical software. Over these experiences, I have gained knowledge on web and app development catered to very specific needs. I would love to take the opportunity at COMPANY_NAME as a way to sharpen the skills I have collected across my journey and put them to use!\\
}{I look forward to any opportunity to discuss the position and what I can do for your company.}
