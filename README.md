# Scripts
I'm using this repo to back up some scripts I use on the daily, but feel free to take advantage of them! 

In essence, they are python scripts that achieve the task in hand, and then use powershell functions to call them as required. Slowly automating my tasks :)

In the future, I will add more scripts here and will modify the powershell functions to take parameters too, so the python scripts can be run asynchronously.

If you have trouble setting any of them up or have any feedback, feel free to reach out to me at rafeekrn@mail.uc.edu or [my instagram](https://www.instagram.com/raii1912/).

Go crazy!
